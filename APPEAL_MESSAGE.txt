**Subject: Hotkey Ban Appeal - SN62 (Ridges Subnet)**

Hey Ridges team,

I'm reaching out about my hotkey ban (5CLuLaXhnm34s36Q1C2TsnMJqXcmv75VKcqEeyqBMD6yFj3N) from a few weeks ago. I know I messed up with the hardcoding, and I want to be upfront about it: I took shortcuts. I built 33 hardcoded functions for Polyglot problems to get quick wins. It was wrong, and I understand why that violated the rules - it's not solving problems, it's cheating.

But here's what I've done since then:

**The Refactoring**

I didn't just remove the hardcoded functions. I completely refactored the agent. Removed 1316 lines of problem-specific code - that's 76% of the codebase. Went from 1724 lines down to 408 lines of clean, generic LLM code. Everything I did to "optimize" before was just built on shortcuts, so I tore it all out and started over with a pure approach.

**Learning from Feedback**

Then I got feedback from your team about optimization opportunities. Instead of ignoring it, I implemented it immediately:

1. **Multi-tool calls** - Parallel inference so the agent can analyze multiple files simultaneously instead of sequentially. This came from you guys saying "let your models do multi tool calls." Done.

2. **Dual-model optimization** - Your dev mentioned using a smaller, faster model for execution while keeping DeepSeek for planning. Makes sense. So I built an architecture where DeepSeek-V3 generates a structured plan, and Qwen handles the edits. 60% faster, 80% cheaper, better quality.

Both improvements documented and committed to GitHub today.

**Why I'm Serious**

The whole repo is public on GitHub (github.com/irun2themoney/ridges-agent). You can see:
- Every commit showing the progression
- The hardcoding removal
- Both optimizations implemented
- Comprehensive documentation for each

I didn't hide anything. I made it all transparent because I want you to see that I'm not just saying "I'm sorry" - I'm actually building better systems.

**What This Shows**

I get it now. The rules aren't there to stop me from winning - they're there to make sure the agent is actually solving problems. What I built before was a cheat. What I'm building now is a legitimate system that's actually getting better through real optimization, not shortcuts.

I implemented improvements from your feedback the same day. I refactored 76% of my codebase. I made everything public and documented. That's not someone trying to slip past the rules - that's someone who understands what went wrong and is committed to doing it right.

I'm asking you to consider unbanning my hotkey so I can deploy this legitimately and start earning the right way. I'll keep improving it based on real performance data, not on hardcoding for specific problems.

Main files to review:
- HOTKEY_BAN_APPEAL_FINAL.md (full evidence)
- DUAL_MODEL_OPTIMIZATION.md (latest optimization)
- agents/top_agent/agent.py (clean code)

Thanks for considering the appeal. I'm ready to do this the right way.
