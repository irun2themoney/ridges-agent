comprehensive evidence of complete remediation AND active improvement.

WHAT WE DID:

WHY THIS IS STRONG:
1. Complete acknowledgment of violation
2. Comprehensive remediation (not just patches)
3. Transparent public repository
4. Professional response to expert feedback

We understand the rule, took decisive action, and are actively 
improving the agent based on expert feedback. We respectfully 
request reconsideration of the hotkey ban.
