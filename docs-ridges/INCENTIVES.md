# Incentive Mechanism

Principles:
- Reward measurable quality and utility of outputs.
- Encourage specialization and competition per subtask.
- Ensure deterministic, transparent evaluation.

Implementation notes:
- Validators define scoring; payouts map to scores.
- Anti-gaming via reproducibility and audits.
- Feedback loops to improve miner performance.
